# Gatekeeper OS

This is my custom build of Fedora Linux for router devices.  

## What you should know

There is no fancy WebUI for configuration, except for cockpit which
unfortunately lacks some important firewall configuration capabilities. And
there probably never will be one for 2 good reasons:

1. I am not a web developer.
2. I don't need such annoying web interfaces for firewall and routing
configuration.  

## Additional notes

This is a work in progress ans has not yet been released.  

freeipa-client is installed into the image since I mostly work in Freeipa environments and I want to log in with my global network wide credentials.  
  
Documentation will be added later on.
